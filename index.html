            My end-goal is to use my business know-how with state-of-the-art analytical skills to extract strategic insights and in turn help create more value in society.

      <h3>Analytics & Development</h3>
      <p> I am well versed in quantitative and qualitative analysis, and I love automating the boring stuff.
          Education and work experience have equipped me with the necessary tools to understand business needs, build ML & statistical models, and extract value from various data sources.
          My preferred tools to give answer to business problems are: Python (Tensorflow, sklearn,+ other), SQL and Tableau. I also have notable experience with Pytorch, Azure, PowerBI and Office.  </p>

      <img class="img-communication" src="images/Communication.gif" alt="img-communication">
      <h3>Communication and Translation</h3>
      <p>I was quite fortunate to have sat in classes of both business-savvy and tech-savvy individuals during my time at university.
          Over time, this has served me well in heterogeneous teams because I could quickly understand both sides and in turn summarize needs and solutions in a timely fashion.
          On a more literal note, I am trilingual, fluent in Dutch, English and Macedonian.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="skill-row">
      <img class="img-curious" src="images/did you know.jpg" alt="img-curious">
      <h3>Staying focussed yet Hyper-Curious</h3>
      <p> <em>"Did you know?"</em> I adore knowledgeable people who ask me this question and at times I cannot help but ask it myself as well.
          Both practical and funny facts are mostly the source of my distractions outside of work.
          When it comes to work however, I am simply able to just zone in and miss any and all irrelevant apocalyptic events from the outside world 😅.

				<strong>(MSc) Information Studies: Data Science</strong>
				<span class="hidden-phone">
                    In this program I brought my data science skills yet a bit further by taking courses in advanced Machine Learning, Deep Learning, text mining and information retrieval, statistics etc.
                    My master thesis was part of my internship with the Energy Transition team at Shell.
                    I finished the program with an average GPA of 8. </span>

                    Chronologically this would be my second bachelor.
                    At the beginning I had only intended to follow some courses from this program as a minor, however I quickly fell in love with the technology and despite the extra workload it proved to be in synergy with my first bachelor.
                    Here I learned quite a lot about algorithms, statistics, machine learning, privacy law, data engineering and implemented this knowledge in five real-world practical projects.
                    These projects were quite diverse, from analysing the performance of Lufthansa's Twitter team through sentiment analysis to building a convolutional neural net to accurately classify <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/#:~:text=Diabetic%20retinopathy%20is%20a%20complication,it%20could%20threaten%20your%20sight.">diabetic retinopathy</a> in four stages of progression.  </span>

				<strong>Junior Business/Data Analyst </strong>
				<span class="hidden-phone">
					During my stay Betapress underwent an early stage of a digital transformation towards a data-driven organization. From my part this was done in terms of a proof-of-concept for customer segmentation by using advanced “unsupervised learning” technics. I provided the firm with more insight into the different types of clients they serve, such that they may better their predictive models and in turn improve inventory management. Through an agile process, I was always in a feedback-loop with the right parties as the project progressed. As the only data-tech-savvy person in the department I had a leading and advisory role as well, since I had to contact the necessary departments to obtain data, technologies and domain knowledge on the project and the IT transition at large.			</span>
