                            I provided the firm with more insight into the different types of clients they serve, such that they may better their predictive models and in turn improve inventory management.
                            Through an agile process, I was always in a feedback-loop with the right parties as the project progressed.
                            As the only data-tech-savvy person in the department, I had a leading and advisory role as well,
